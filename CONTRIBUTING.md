### Style

New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org).

### Changes to article

The latest version of the tutorial is hosted at [https://pricing-tutorial.netlify.com/](https://pricing-tutorial.netlify.com/). To make changes:

1. Fork the repo and create a new branch.
2. Modify `article/article.Rmd`.
3. Run the build script `build_article_preview.R`.
4. If you're happy with what you see in `public/index.html`, send a PR.

Once the PR is created, a preview version should be deployed and you'll be able to see it in the build details.
